## Why Fullstack Serverless will be the next big trend and why you should know about it?

The world is developing rapidly with rapid improvements in technology. In this fast-moving world, we the developers also need to tie our shoes tight to focus on running faster! 🏃‍♂️🥈

Today, I'm talking about the serverless architecture that will help fasten the development process for your months-long project and take care of its scalability.

Now, **what does going serverless mean**? Is it that there are going to be no servers? No. That's not the case. But instead of maintaining servers and their resources and scaling, the serverless architecture handles all of it, thus making the developer more focused on core projects and efficiency.

Below are some answers to **why one should try it!**👇🎯, at the end of the article I've mentioned some **FREE** platforms that will let you try going Serverless.
 
### Highly scalable and Less Expensive

- ** Why care about scalability? **
Suppose you built a web app that has 10k users a month. Now suddenly it takes a jump and the number of users increases from 5k to 100k a month globally.
You'll be like oh wow! but wait, can your "not so serverless" web application handle 20x traffic? probably not. You'll need to increase the hardware resource of your server. (generally, need to purchase a bigger tier of dedicated server) and will require to ship your web app thereby incurring more cost and less scalability. 

- ** Does Serverless architecture solves this? Yes**. with a serverless architecture, your web app and API are served over [CDN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network), and therefore people accessing from different region won't face performance issues. Thus it also cost less expensive.

- Everything can be served over CDN, hence making it faster.

- If you are planning to grow your tech startup, or be the next (@[Hashnode](@hashnode)). Go for serverless for greater scalability. 📈 🤩

### Faster Development

- Serverless architecture reduces coding efforts and time, by just simply removing the need of setting up and maintaining a server by yourself. Here is a quick example of [Complete backend and database under 15 minutes for any application! (React / Angular / Vue) AWS Amplify Admin UI 🔥 - Getting started](https://blog.amaan.codes/complete-backend-and-database-under-15-minutes-for-any-application-react-angular-vue-aws-amplify-admin-ui-getting-started)

### Compatible with modern web frameworks and libraries such as React, Angular, and Vue.

- Serverless architecture can be implemented in almost all popular web frameworks such as React, Angular, Vue, etc. 

- In the end, the Fullstack serverless application compiles everything into static pages that can be served over a CDN. 

- [AWS Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/), [Netlify Functions](https://www.netlify.com/products/functions/), [Firebase Functions](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions), [AWS Lamba](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) are a great way to get started with a serverless architecture for **FREE**
