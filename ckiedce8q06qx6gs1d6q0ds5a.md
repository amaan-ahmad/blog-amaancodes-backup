- You will see something like the above picture, now if you don't have an AWS account you can try this out by selecting "Data" and a local sandbox will be created for you.

- After selecting data, you will be asked to select a scheme, for this post I will go with "blank schema" because we want to create our own. 

#### Now let's add a model. Amplify follows a NoSQL DB. So, here the model is relatable to a table in SQL

- After adding a model, you can create its fields, as I did:

#### Now we'll go for testing this model in our application, to proceed further select the button in the top right corner, which says "Next: Test locally in your app"

### Testing

- You can select any of the supported platform and framework you like, for this post I will be selecting Web as the platform and React as a framework.
- After selecting the platform and the framework. Click next and follow the step mentioned there.
- Now as you have AWS amplify installed, and your application setup, it's time for pulling the amplify sandbox configurations into your application.
```
amplify pull --sandboxId your-sandbox-id-here-without-quotation-marks
```
- Now, install aws-amplify and typescript library to your react application.
```
npm install aws-amplify typescript
```
- Use the following code in index.js, to configure your application

```
import Amplify from 'aws-amplify'
import awsconfig from './aws-exports'

Amplify.configure(awsconfig);
```
- Now we are ready to test ours react application with AWS Amplify.

#### You can play around and test the various CRUD operations locally to see how it all works and later you can deploy it to the cloud ( need an AWS account for this ).
